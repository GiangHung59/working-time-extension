    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>ChatGPT TOC (Table of Contents) </strong></p>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 09, 2025</p>

    <p>We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how the ChatGPT Table of Contents extension ("the Extension") collects, uses, and protects your data while you use it on <a href="https://chatgpt.com" target="_blank">chatgpt.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The ChatGPT Table of Contents extension does <strong>not collect or store any personal information</strong>. The Extension operates entirely on your device and only accesses the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chat content on chatgpt.com:</strong> The Extension reads the content of your conversations on chatgpt.com to generate and update the table of contents (TOC). This data is processed locally and is not transmitted or stored anywhere.</li>
      <li><strong>User preferences:</strong> The Extension saves your panel settings (such as size and position) using Chrome's <code>storage</code> API. These settings are stored locally on your device and are not shared with any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The Extension uses the chat content on chatgpt.com solely to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate a table of contents for your conversations, allowing you to navigate messages easily.</li>
      <li>Automatically update the TOC when you send a message or receive a response from ChatGPT.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Extension uses your saved preferences to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain your customized panel size and position across browsing sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We <strong>do not share, sell, or transfer any data</strong> collected by the Extension to any third party. All data processing occurs locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not store any personal data or chat content. The only data stored is your panel settings, which are saved locally on your device using Chrome's <code>storage</code> API. This data is encrypted and only accessible to the Extension on your browser.</p>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, but as the Extension operates locally, no data is transmitted over the internet.</p>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The Extension requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To read the content of the current tab on chatgpt.com and generate the table of contents.</li>
      <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your panel settings (size and position) locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are strictly necessary for the Extension to function as intended. No other permissions are requested.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not interact with any third-party services, APIs, or servers. All functionality is self-contained within the Extension and operates locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Extension's functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here, and the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will be revised accordingly. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about this Privacy Policy or the ChatGPT Table of Contents extension, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page or open an issue on our GitHub repository:</p>
